I developed an ATM application in C# language where users can manage their bank accounts. 
After password verification, the user can access the ATM menu. 
Using the menu, they can perform transactions such as balance inquiry, deposit and withdrawal. 
This console-based application, which provides user interaction, includes the necessary functions to perform basic bank transactions.
